* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -29 and +29 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -30 and +30 percent
